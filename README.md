The upcoming website framework for Encrypt Coding Official.
This branch is to be used for committing unreviewed code. Any new commits must be added here. All 'main' commits are merges of 'temp' into 'main'.

TO DEVELOPERS:
- Agenda is high priority and must be completed before working on others.
- If agenda is assigned to you, you are the primary individual to work on it. However, you are free to request help from others.
- Always check the 'Issues' for your work.
